## :bookmark: About

I am a Civil Engineer and my professional career can be summarized in civil engineering related jobs. However, I have decided to challenge myself and learn something new, like coding. :computer:

I have always enjoyed computers, games and technology, so I thought "Why not try coding? ", and so, I did. I have been teaching myself coding for web development for a while and now, with CoGrammar bootcamp, I am aiming to improve my skills to a competitive level and achieve my first job in the tech industry.

I am motivated to learn new technologies, always in constant professional development, quickly learning problem-solving, with great interest in web-dev.

A bit more about me is that I was born and raised in Brazil and I consider myself a good and simple person. In my free time you will probably find me watching a good movie, playing a game on my computer or studying coding.
